// Unused functions: there suddenly are a lot of unused function errors
// We could address those by adding for instance early declarations or
// (unnecessary) header files, but they were all somewhat false positives
// When we upgrade past 1.56, we should re-check this, and perhaps enable
// unused-functions again.
